st.write("Hi there,This post is about building something pertaining to the job market that is plaguing a lot of us. It’s not just tough but borderline impossible to land opportunities with the conventional definition of ‘job hunting’. Cold applications? Terrible idea. By the time you open that Linkedin job posting, 800 folks have already applied. Referrals? Maybe, but aren’t getting them tougher than asking out your distant crush? Then we stumbled upon the concept of ‘Informational Interviews’  - Which is a form of networking where you reach out to folks working at your dream company and plant the initial seed to a long term relationship. But does conducting ample information interviews guarantee you a job? No. Because not all companies are hiring. Even if they have released a job posting, you are probably the nth candidate to apply. So what is the solution? Identifying those companies which shall have open positions in the near future and then networking with individuals from that organization. One great indicator of any company’s upward hiring habit is their influx of capital, or in other words if they have raised funds or not. This isn’t an extensive trend but, for tech startups in the valley, this observation fits the scale. For the sake of brevity- tech startups which have raised funds recently are MORE likely to hire than the one that have not.So welcome to Hustler. Another job search tool? Fortunately, no. Hustler is not focused on searching jobs that are already posted on the internet but to predict job openings (mostly at tech startups) even before it is posted. We list out startups that have recently raised funds (in the last 3 months) along with probable folks to connect with. But what are you going to talk to them about? Hustler is equipped with a custom agent called HustlerAI that asks for a write up about you (something that conveys your story and passion) and the url company in which you are interested. It researches about the company and crafts a tailored message matching your skills with the core ethos of the company - ready for you to conduct next information interviews at scale.If this sounds promising to you, we have released a waitlist for Hustler. This is a weekend exploration Kabeer Andrabi and I  brought together to help our friends and whoever is looking for a job in this tumultuous market.  We plan to release Hustler in the coming week so our waitlisted folks get early access to this initiative! In this journey we plan to actively seek feedback to improve Hustler to help you in your job search process!Link to the waitlist: https://kapjew87rwx.typeform.com/to/iy4pKBshTo all the Hustlers out there!")
